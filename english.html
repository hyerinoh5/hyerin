<h4>Here are 3 things (in no particular order) you can do to improve your English</h4>
<ol>
<li>Don’t be afraid to make mistakes. Be confident. People can only correct your mistakes when they hear you make them.</li>
<li>Surround yourself in English. Put yourself in an all English speaking environment where you can learn passively. The best way to learn is through speaking.</li>
<li>Practise every day. Make yourself a study plan. Decide how much time a week you are going to spend studying and stick to it. Establish a routine.</li>
